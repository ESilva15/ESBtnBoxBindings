# ESBtnBoxBindings
This mod creates new binds to handle:
- Lights
- Diff locks
- Range box
- Ignition
- Starter


Becasue in BeamNG.drive currently the user can only assign a single key to toggle across the
multiple positions for each one of those settings, which doesn't really work well with toggle
switches.


With this mod you can have a `On - Off - On` toggle switch with 2 distinct states that can stay in
each of its positions to turn something on and when returning to the Off position it will turn it
off.

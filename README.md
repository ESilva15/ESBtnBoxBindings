# ESBtnBoxBindings
This mod creates new binds to handle:
- Headlights
- Lightbar
- Differentials
- Range box
- Ignition
- Starter


# Why this exists
In BeamNG.drive most binds are expecting a single key press to either toggle
across multiple states of a given device or just toggle from `on` and `off`.

For example, on the rangebox it goes:
`H2 -> Press -> H4 -> Press -> L4 -> Press -> H2`

We cannot manually set the range box to `L4` or `H2`. We have to toggle across
its available modes.

This mod extends the default BeamNG.drive keybinds to allow selecting what mode
we want to be in.
